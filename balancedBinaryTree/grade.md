### Comments:
- So, what's with the balance methods?
- I had to do some formatting and adding ":" colons to your "balance" method to make it run.
- After that, it did ... something. Your extend method was blowing up the size of the array, so I would dare say it wasn't balanced.
- Other than that, it looks like you didn't change the original code to much.  
- Also come see me after class, I would like to discuss your code. You had an interesting approach. This is not a request, it's a you have to come see me :)
